### Introduction
When we hear our favorite song, our brains recognize it instantly. When soundwaves graze our eardrums, they fire off several neurons that allow us to instantly recognize the collection of frequencies being produced. For a music recognition algorithm like Shazam, itâ€™s a much different scenario: Our job will be to apply machine learning techniques, Fourier Transforms, and Hashing to help our algorithm distinguish between your favorite songs!

### Goals
- Learn the basics of Python and Matplotlib
- Understand the intuition behind the Shazam algorithm
- Learn about and implement Fourier transforms and hash functions 
- Build our own Shazam clone algorithms using machine learning techniques
- HAVE FUN!!!

### Project Setup
1. Install ffmpeg:
```
$ brew install ffmpeg sqlite3 
```
2. Clone this repo
3. Make a workspace in VS Code
4. Create a virtual environment within the workspace folder:
```
$ python3 -m venv env
```
5. Activate your virtual environment:
```
$ source env/bin/activate
```
6. Install the required dependencies:
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
